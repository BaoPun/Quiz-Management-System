# Description

# How to Run This Program
Because this project is not hosted on the web, you must first have an IDE that supports Java, such as Spring Tool Suites (STS) or Eclipse.  Once you successfully have either IDE downloaded onto your computer, click on the green "Code" button on the screen and then choose "Download as ZIP."  Once you have downloaded the ZIP file, extract the folder to any location in your computer.  Open up one of the IDEs you downloaded, go to File -> Open Projects From File System.  From here, select the folder itself, and then confirm that option.  Shortly afterwards, you will then be able to see the project loaded onto your Package Explorer on the left hand side.  Finally, right click on the root folder (titled Spring-Project-2), hover onto Run As, and then choose Spring Boot App.  From here, you should be able to see the Console running Spring, and after you see a "Started SpringProject2Application in * seconds (JVM running for *)" (the * just means a particular time), type the following into one of your browsers: "localhost:8080".  From here, you can now use our application.
